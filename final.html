			<h3>Breakfast is the most important meal of the day </h3>
			<p > Breakfast is said to be ‘the most important meal of the day’ and there is some truth to it. But one popular breakfast food has little health benefits. A bowl of cereal might be quick and tasty but most American cereals contain an average of 7 grams of added sugar, with some having up to 17 added grams. As the name suggests, <a href=https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/breakfast 
			> breakfast breaks the overnight fasting period</a>. It replenishes your supply of glucose to boost your energy levels and alertness, while also providing other essential nutrients required for good health. According to the updated standards from the FDA, a healthy stamp would be given to cereals that have three-fourth ounces of whole grains and no more than 1 gram of saturated fat, 230 milligrams of sodium and 2.5 grams of added sugars. And cereal is made from refined grains in a highly processed way with many additives (EWG).</p>

			<h3>High sugar cereals are marketed to children</h3>
			<div id="image">
				<img src="sugar_jpeg.jpg" alt="sugar statistic graphic" height="500" width="300" align="right"> 
			<p>Some of the most popular and well-known cereals should be considered desserts with the amount of added sugars. Take Lucky Charms, Cookie Crisps, Apple Jacks, and Frosted Flakes for instance. Each of these cereals have at least 10 grams of sugars per serving. And keep in mind these servings are usually 1 cup or less and calculated without milk (and who eats cereal without milk?) But topping the charts at a whopping 17 grams of total sugars is Cap’n Crunch. It also has 290 milligrams of sodium and 33 grams of total carbohydrates.</p>

			<p id="with-element"> Most cereals are aimed for younger children and usually feature a cartoon mascot. Lucky Charms has the iconic leprechaun and Frosted Flakes has Tony the Tiger. Both have become household images, making many children gravitate towards the packaging. </p>

			<h3>Nutrition Studies say Nutrition Liteacy is Lacking in the U.S. </h3>
			
			<p> Nutrition literacy is defined as the degree to which people have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic nutrition information. Higher nutrition literacy has been associated with the consumption of a higher-quality diet that is rich in fruits and vegetables. On the other hand, lower health literacy has been shown to be associated with various health issues. 

			<p > A <a href=https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2017/05/18/US-consumers-sorely-lack-nutritional-literacy-IFIC-survey-reveals> 2017 survey by the International Food Information Council Foundation</a> found 78% of American consumers encountered a lot of conflicting information about what to eat and avoid. Only 45% of respondents could identify foods and nutrients associated with health benefits. 

			<p> More than 80% of people in the U.S. aren’t eating enough vegetables, fruit and dairy, according to the <a href=https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials> Dietary Guidelines for America, 2020-2025</a>. And most people consume too much added sugars, saturated fat and sodium. That’s concerning because unhealthy dietary patterns can increase the risk of some of the most common chronic diseases.
			
			<p> Rose Sarner, a junior studying nutrition, food access, and urban food policy, claims food literacy is lacking in the U.S. which leads to misinformation and uncertainty when making food-related decisions. 

			<p> "Here in the United States, young kids, teens, and adults have little knowledge about the foods they are putting into their bodies, where the food is coming from, or how different foods affect their overall health," Sarner said. 
			
			According to <a href=https://www.fastcompany.com/90613597/54-4-million-americans-dont-have-access-to-healthy-food-thats-a-design-problem> Fast Company</a>, 54 million Americans do not have access to healthy food, and according to <a href=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/08/03/487640479/75-percent-of-americans-say-they-eat-healthy-despite-evidence-to-the-contrary> NPR</a>, 80 percent of Americans fail to eat the recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables. 
			
			<p> Sarner reiterates that food literacy is directly related to access to food and economics. 

			<p> "If people are living off of food from convenience stores and fast-food franchises that are filled with chemicals, it will ultimately lead to their risk of diseases in the future," Sarner said. "Access to fresh produce is one factor that will aid citizens’ health, however, being educated about the food you are putting into your body is what will affect long term change."

			<h3>FDA guidance aims to educate and improve on the American diet </h3>
			

			<p>“Healthy food can lower our risk for chronic disease. But too many people may not know what constitutes healthy food,” said the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Xavier Becerra, in <a href=https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/11/fda-redefined-healthy-these-7-cereals-do-not-qualify.html> the FDA’s statement</a>.
			“FDA’s move will help educate more Americans to improve health outcomes, tackle health disparities and save lives.”</p> 
			<p>The previous definition of the nutrient content claim “healthy” was set in 1994. Now, this update from the FDA reflects current nutrition science, federal dietary guidance, especially the <a href=https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials> Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025</a>, and the updated Nutrition Facts label. </p>

			<p>Heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, some cancers and obesity are among the leading causes of death in the U.S., with minority groups at greater risk. While more than 4 in 10 American adults have high blood pressure, that number increases to almost 6 in 10 for non-Hispanic Black adults.

			<p>Updating the “healthy” definition is a step towards providing the public with information that can help them identify the best food choices that can help lead to reducing diet-related illness and advancing health equity. Updating the “healthy” definition also could lead to businesses providing more healthy foods in stores.
